# Portfolio
A portfolio of code I show to employers. The electron time of flight program is part of my Physics MSci research project and, as such, may be incomplete and edited constantly. The Google coding challenge was to design a software that would simulate a simple YouTube-like program that would pause and play (imaginary) videos when commanded to do so. The vast majority of work on this code is in the 'Video Player' in the file 'src'. It hasn't been completed but I felt it was a good indication of my ability to teach myself new skills as I previously had never used Python for software design in this way and I found the experience very enlightening.
